## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I explored core ML concepts such as:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Applying classification/regression using traditional ML algorithms

The goal was to build a simple, interpretable ML model on a structured dataset as part of strengthening foundational skills in AI and data science.
